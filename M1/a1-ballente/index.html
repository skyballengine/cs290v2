        Within the language of websites and servers, index.html is the default name of the home page of the website for Apache web servers.
        Other platforms may have other default names, such as default.html.

    <p>
        When inspecting the file run from the OSU ENGR file system, the network tab in the developer tools shows that an HTTP request was made and an HTTP response was received.
        However, when the file was run from the local machine, there was no HTTP request. This is due to the fact that the HTTP protocol is not used when using files from a local machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The favicon.ico file shows a 200 status because it was found due to the fact that we are using OSU's server, and it provides the favicon file needed.
        However, main.css and main.js are not found and throw a 404 status code because they don't exist yet within the a1-ballente directory. This is considered a client error because the browser cannot find those resources.
